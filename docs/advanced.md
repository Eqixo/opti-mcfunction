# Introduction

This document is a collection of more advanced methods and techniques that can be used to improve the performance of your datapacks. It is not meant to be a complete guide, but rather a collection of tips and tricks that can be used to improve your datapacks.

Unlike the [basics of optimization document](./basics.md), this document is not meant to be read from top to bottom. Each section is independent from the others, and you can read them in any order you want. That's why there is no indices to each section.

The goal is to gather more advanced methods, giving links and references to external sources. The methods can be mcfunction specific, or more general optimization methods of programming.
